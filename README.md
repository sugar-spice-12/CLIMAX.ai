# CLIMAX.ai  
### Climate Intelligence & Mitigation Action Exchange

CLIMAX.ai is a distributed **Climate Action Trigger Network** designed for high-density coastal cities such as **Singapore and Hong Kong**.

Unlike traditional weather dashboards, this platform focuses on **coordinated operational adaptation** during compound climate stress events such as:

- Heavy rainfall × Traffic congestion × Drainage saturation  
- Heatwave × Peak grid demand  
- Storm surge × High tide × Coastal infrastructure density  

The goal is to reduce cascading failures by synchronizing decentralized urban actors before systemic overload occurs.

## Key Features

-  Interactive urban network visualization  
-  Compound Risk Index calculation  
-  Multi-hazard Trigger Engine  
-  Institutional Response Library  
-  Real-time synchronization simulation  
-  Resilience metrics dashboard  
-  Singapore & Hong Kong scenario modes

## System Concept

CLIMAX.ai transforms climate signals into coordinated micro-adaptations across:

- Transport systems  
- Campuses  
- Commercial districts  
- Logistics hubs  
- Micro-grids  

Instead of only predicting risk, the system activates synchronized operational adjustments to stabilize urban systems.
